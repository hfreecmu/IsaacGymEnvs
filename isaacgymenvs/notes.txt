final_project_stationary_ball_no_trees:
stationary ball no trees

final_project_moving_ball_trees:
started with stationary ball
fine tuned where removed quat error from reward
fine tuned again with movement
fine tuned third time with reset/collision penalty

final_project_stationary_ball_adv_mix:
stationary ball with advantage mixing
there is quat error
there are trees

final_project_fixed_cam_stationary_ball:
fixed cam stationary ball. no quat error
there are trees

final_project_fixed_cam_moving_ball
fixed cam moving ball. no quat error
there are trees

final_project_moving_ball_trees_v2
trial again moving ball with trees
started training with stationary ball and fine tuned
there is not quat error
this was just another trial where it was 
based off branches 
final_project_fixed_cam_stationary_ball and 
final_project_fixed_cam_moving_ball
